☐ Create database schema @started(25-08-19 08:26)
  - Define models for the application @started(25-08-21 00:30)
  - Use a migration tool to create the initial schema
    - Run migrations to set up tables and relationships
  - Verify schema by checking the database structure

☐ Seed the database with initial data from the provided CSV files
  - Write scripts to read CSV files and insert data into the database
  - Ensure data integrity and consistency during the seeding process
  - Validate that the data has been correctly inserted by querying the database

☐ Implement basic CRUD operations for the main entities
  - Create endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records
    - Test each endpoint to ensure they work as expected
☐ Set up a development environment for testing
  - Use a testing framework to write unit and integration tests
    - Create test cases for the CRUD operations
    - Run tests to ensure functionality and catch any bugs early
☐ Document the setup and usage of the database
  - Write a README file with instructions on how to set up the database
  - Include details on how to run migrations and seed the database
  - Provide examples of API requests for CRUD operations
☐ Review and optimize database performance
    - Analyze query performance and optimize slow queries
    - Consider indexing frequently queried fields
    - Monitor database performance metrics and adjust configurations as needed
