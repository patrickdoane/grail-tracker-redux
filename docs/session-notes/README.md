# Session Notes

Chronological development logs captured during Codex sessions. Files are named using the ISO date format (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) so they sort naturally.

## Structure
- `YYYY-MM-DD.md` â€” session summary for the specified date.

Add new notes by dropping additional markdown files into this directory following the same naming pattern.
